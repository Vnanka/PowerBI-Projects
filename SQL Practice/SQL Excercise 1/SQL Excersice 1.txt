SQL Subqueries nested in SELECT and FROM - Exercise Text

Task 1:

Starting your code with “DROP TABLE”, create a table called “emp_manager”
(emp_no – integer of 11, not null; dept_no – CHAR of 4, null; manager_no – integer of 11, not null).

Task 2:
Fill emp_manager with data about employees, the number of the department they are working in, and their managers.


Your query skeleton must be:

INSERT INTO emp_manager
SELECT
	U.*
FROM 
		(a)
		UNION
		(B)
		UNION
		(C)
		UNION
		(D) AS
    U


A and B should be the same subsets used in the last lecture 
(SQL Subqueries Nested in SELECT and FROM). In other words, assign employee number 110022 as 
a manager to all employees from 10001 to 10020 (this must be subset A), 
and employee number 110039 as a manager to all employees from 10021 to 10040 (this must be subset B).


Following the same logic, create subset D. Here you must do the opposite - assign employee 110022 as a manager to employee 110039.

Your output must contain 42 rows.
